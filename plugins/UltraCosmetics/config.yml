#
# - 'nonnegative': UC will assume that players must have a non-negative balance to make a purchase,
#     but will still check whether the economy plugin returned a success.
#     You may need this if your economy plugin runs async and doesn't immediately
#     know whether a transaction can be performed.
#
# - 'force-nonnegative': UC will assume that players must have a non-negative balance to make a purchase,
#     and will assume success regardless of what the economy plugin returns.
#     You should ONLY use this if your economy plugin responds improperly to UC's requests,
#     for example returning null instead of a response.
